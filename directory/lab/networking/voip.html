<h3>Question</h3>
</p>
<p>
How do you troubleshoot out-of-order voip packets, which two options cause out-of-order packets? (Choose two)
</p>
<p>
 <ol type="A">
  <li>a routing loop</li>
  <li>a router in the packet flow path that is intermittently dropping packets</li>
  <li>high latency</li>  
  <li>packets in a flow traversing multiple paths through the network</li>
  <li>some packets in a flow being process-switched and other being interrupt-switched on a transit router</li>
</ol> 
</p>
<p>
<h3>
Answer: D, E
</h3>
</p>
<p>
In traditional packet forwarding systems,  using different paths have varying latencies that cause out of order packets, eventually resulting in far lower performance for the network application. Also, if some packets are process switched quickly by the routing engine of the router while others are interrupt switched (which takes more time) then it could result in out of order packets. The other options would cause packet drops or latency, but not out of order packets.
