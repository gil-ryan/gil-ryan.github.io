<h2>Task</h2>
In the topology diagram, notice that router R1 now has a Loopback interface. In this task you will be advertising that loopback into EIGRP, and then manipulating the EIGRP distance on Router-4 so that it load-balances traffic to this new network across both the Serial and FastEthernet interfaces of router R4.
<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>If you are doing this lab on your own equipment, ensure that the Bandwidth or clockrate of your Serial interface on R4 connecting to R1 is set to 128 Kbps.
<ol type="I">
<li>On router R1, add a new "network" command (along with a specific wildcard mask) to your EIGRP process so that the network on your Loopback0 interface is advertised into EIGRP.</li>
<li>View the IP routing table on router R4 and verify that the preferred path to reach this new subnet is via the FastEthernet link leading upstream to router R2.</li>
<li>On router R4, view the EIGRP Topology table, specifically for network 111.111.111.0/29, and notice the difference between the current Feasible Distance and the total Distance of the path to this same network via the Serial link.</li>
</ol>	
<h3>Answer this question:</h3> 
If your objective were to load-balance packets destined to 111.111.111.0 equally across your FastEthernet and Serial interfaces on router R4, do you think there would be a way, by changing JUST the bandwidth or JUST the delay of interface Serial1/3 (not both) on R4, that you could achieve that goal?
- If you answered "yes": What value would you select as the new bandwidth, or the new delay?
If you answered "no": Why do you consider this impossible?
