<h2>Network Time Protocol (NTP)</h2>
<hr>
<p>
NTP is designed to synchronize the time on network of machines. NTP runs over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), using port 123 as both the source and destination, which in turn runs over IP. NTP Version 3 RFC 1305 is used to synchronize timekeeping among a set of distributed time servers and clients. A set of nodes on a network are identified and configured with NTP and the nodes from a synchronization subnet, sometimes referred to as an overlay network. While multiple masters (primary servers) may exist, there is no requirement for an election protocol.
</p>
<p>
An NTP network usually gets its time from an authoritive time source, such as a radio or clock or an atomic clock attached to a time server. NTP then distributes this time across the network. An NTP client makes a transaction with its server over its polling interval (from 64 to 1024) which dynamically changes over time depending on the network conditions between the NTP server and client. The other situation occurs when the router communicates to a bad NTP (for example, NTP server with large dispersion); the router also increases the poll interval. No more than one NTP transaction per minute is needed to synchronize two machines. It is not possible to adjust the NTP poll interval on a router.
</p>
<p>
NTP uses the concept of stratum to describe how many NTP hops away a machine is from an authoritive time source. For example, a stratum 1 time server has a radio or atomic clock directly attached to it. It then sends its time to a stratum 2 server through NTP, and so on. A machin running NTP automatically chooses the machine with the lowest possible stratum number that is configured to communicat with using NTP as its time source. This strategy effectively builds a self-organizing tree of NTP speakers. NTP performs well over the non-deterministic path lengths of packet-switched networks, because it makes robust estimated of the following three key variables in the relationship between a client and a time server.
