Drag and drop the challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol steps from the left into the correct order in which they occur on the right.

<h3>Answer:
</h3>
<p> 
<ol type="I">
<li>target 1 = when the LCP phase is complete and CHAP is negotiated between both devices, the authenticator sends a challenge message to the peer</li>
<li>target 2 = the peer responds with a value calculated through a one-way hash function (MD5)</li>
<li>target 3 = the authenticator checks the response against its own calculation of the expected hash value, if the values match the authentication is successful, otherwise, the connection is terminated</li>
</ol>

The Challenged Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) (defined in RFC 1994) verifies the identity of the peer by means of a three-way handshake. These are the general steps performed in CHAP;
</p>
<ol>
<li>After the LCP (Link Control Protocol) phase is complete, and CHAP is negotiated between both devices, the authenticator sends a challenge message to the peer.<li>
<li>The peer responds with a value calculated through a one-way hash function (Message Digest 5 (MD5))</li>
<li>The authenticator checks the response against its own calculator of the expected has value. If the values match, the authentication is successful. Otherwise, the connection is terminated.</li>
</ol>
