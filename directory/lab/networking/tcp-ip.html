<h2>Transmission Control Protoco/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</h2>
<hr>
<p>
A network engineer wants to ensure an optimal end-to-end delay bandwidth product. The delay is less than 64 KB. Which TCP feature ensures steady state throughput?
</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>A. Window scaling</li>
<li>B. Network buffers</li>
<li>C. Round-trip timers</li>
<li>D. TCP acknowledgments</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A</p>
<p>Options can be carried in a TCP header, those relevant to TCP performance include:</p>
<p>Window-scale option: The option is intended to address the issue of the maximum window size in the face of paths that exhibit a high-delay bandwidth product. This option allows the window size advertisement to be right-shifted by the amount specified (in binary arithmetic, a right-shift corresponds to a multiplcation by 2). Without this option, the maximum window size that can be advertises is 65,535 bytes(the maximum value obtainable in a 16-bit field).</p>
<p>The limit of TCP transfer speed is effectively one window size in transit between the sender and receiver. For high-speed, long-delay networks, this performance limitation is a significant factor, because it limits the transfer rate to at most 65,535 bytes per round-trip interval, regardless of available network capacity. Use of the window-scal option allows the TCP sender to effectively adapt to high bandwidth, high-delay network paths, by allowing more data to be help in flight. The maximum window size with this option.</p>
