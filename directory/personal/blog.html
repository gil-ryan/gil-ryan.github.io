<p id="quotation"> 
"Everything's changing around me, these days don't feel the same, We all lost faith and lost family...Why must we play this game? Lord have mercy on me, I've been a sinnin' man. Pull out my wings, jump off the bridge & crash in a plane..If I never land, know I never die. We live forever, in my mind. And I, say goodbye. We live forever, still alive...There's a lot goin' on but I stick to the ones I love, I never claimed to be a perfect man but name a great man who was, Consequences of my actions in the past years had me stressin' out..."

I guess there's a time and place for everything. There's a lot going on, which leads me to write this. Progress is what I'm truly alluding to, leaving those 'demons' behind.

<p>
Just never stop believing.
