<p>Me neither. Then I did hear about it,<strong> and I definitely didn't like what I was hearing.</strong> <strong>Trigeminal neuralgia </strong>, or  <strong>Tic Douloureuxis </strong>, is a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from your face to your brain</p>
<p>A pain often described as being stabbed in the face with an icepick.</p>
