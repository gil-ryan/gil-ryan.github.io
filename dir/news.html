<p>So I think it's important to set goals. Otherwise, you're kind of aimlessly working towards nothing. This could lead to derailing, of sorts. I've always had an issue doing that. Anyhow, my job is really kind of pidgeon-holing me into learning things. I've been putting of things for a while to recharge and supplement correcting my burnout.</p>>
<p>Many I.T. professionals are aware,  where other trains may be not, burnout is extremely common in the Information Technology side of the house. There is an overwhelming amount of new information to learn, every single day. Once you've mastered something, it turns out you're working on a deprecated piece of crap technology that is laughable. Is it fair? No, but that's just how it works.</p>
<p>OK,so anyway, I'm working on Cisco training courses for their certifications which have been newly revamped. <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html" >You can take a look at them here.</a> I'm certain nobody is going to want to, but I'll probably add some of my first lab entries based on the CCNP professional security level. Cheers!</p>

<p>Arrgh! I've made another entry, that's two days in a row! Not that I don't work most days, I just don't make entries as often as I should.</p>
<p>Who knows? Maybe, just maybe, I'll hang out tomorrorw too and do another entry.</p>

<p>Thus far, I've had a great time creating static websites that aren't quite 'production' material yet. So I've finally had enough and decided it's time that I make things a little more thorough and complete with some server-side capabilities.</p> 
<p>That being said, I've taken it upon myself to begin broaching some php and completing the code to really begin thriving and creating a true platform that will showcase my experience.</p>
<p>A timeline of updates are due next. Thanks myself, for all of your patience and hard work.</p>
