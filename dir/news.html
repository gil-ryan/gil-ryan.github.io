        <p>Here's another update for you! I didn't think I'd get so busy, or too depressed to do any work, ha. The quarantine has been boring, that's for sure. Here's something nobody today me in life:</p>
        <p>Your brain doesn't really lose all of the creativity you had as a child. You just lose the motivation. Things become a tad bit drearier as you age. Like, what's the point? Your burning passion is simply an effort that eventually extinguishes. That's not to say I'm depressed, and I don't mean to have such a droll tone as I write this. It's just kind of a thought that's peaked in my mind. Anyway, I'll be putting some of my work up as tutorials eventually, I fucking swear I will. Not that anyone will use it until I'm dead or something. If even.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="article_title1">March 27th, 2020</h1>

        <p>So I think it's important to set goals. Otherwise, you're kind of aimlessly working towards nothing. This could lead to derailing, of sorts. I've always had an issue doing that. Anyhow, my job is really kind of pidgeon-holing me into learning things. I've been putting off things for a while to recharge and supplement correcting my burnout.</p>
        <p>Many I.T. professionals are aware, where other trains maybe not: burnout is extremely common in the Information Technology side of the house. There is an overwhelming amount of new information to learn, every single day. Once you've mastered something, it turns out you're working on a deprecated piece of crap technology that 20-year olds and self-proclaimed know-it-alls laugh at. Is it fair? No, but that's just how it works.</p>
        <p>OK,so anyway, I'm working on Cisco training courses for their certifications which have been newly revamped. <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html">You can take a look at them here.</a> I'm certain nobody is going to want to, but I'll probably add some of my first lab entries based on the CCNP professional security level. Cheers!</p>

        <p>Arrgh! I've made another entry, that's two days in a row! Not that I don't work most days, I just don't make entries as often as I should.</p>
        <p>Who knows? Maybe, just maybe, I'll hang out tomorrorw too and do another entry.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="article_title1">March 25th, 2020</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Thus far, I've had a great time creating static websites that aren't quite 'production' material yet. So I've finally had enough and decided it's time that I make things a little more thorough and complete with some server-side capabilities.</p>
        <p>That being said, I've taken it upon myself to begin broaching some php and completing the code to really begin thriving and creating a true platform that will showcase my experience.</p>
        <p>A timeline of updates are due next. Thanks myself, for all of your patience and hard work.</p>
