        <p>Another day, another dollar! I wish I was using this page to vent and keep as a diary of sorts. Maybe I will eventually, but not for the moment. Otherwise I wouldn't have some very nice things to say all the time. You can already guess that it may have some implications in my personal life</p>
        <p>Anyhow, I'm hoping everyone has a nice day today! I'm so tired that I'm basically nodding out, so have a good one!</p>
        <br>

        <p>So here we finally are. Time and time again I've had to restructure, rearrange, and delete my comprehensive notes for technology development. It's taken me a great amount of time to come up with an adequate way of tracking all of my notes, and now I've finally found the solution I've been looking for.</p>
        <p>Anyway, this resource is to be leveraged as a simple, no bullshit guide to programming and the likes. Regardless if anything here are applicable or helpful, I welcome you and hope you find some content you like.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Cool, so just another test status update. I've been testing updates a lot but it looks like I have all of my templates put together and everything that I'll need. I'll be working on a lot of art, audio, and technical aspects of my life and making this page a center piece.</p>

        <p>Well, in case you're wondering: yes, that is me prepared for the next few months of hard work.</p>

        <h1 id="article_title1">August 10th, 2020</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I'm back and the next series of content I create will be official. It will consist of Networking, Programming, and Mathetmatics. Wish me luck!</p>

        <p>Here's another update for you! I didn't think I'd get so busy, or too depressed to do any work, ha. The quarantine has been boring, that's for sure. Here's something nobody today me in life:</p>
        <p>Your brain doesn't really lose all of the creativity you had as a child. You just lose the motivation. Things become a tad bit drearier as you age. Like, what's the point? Your burning passion is simply an effort that eventually extinguishes. That's not to say I'm depressed, and I don't mean to have such a droll tone as I write this. It's just kind of a thought that's peaked in my mind. Anyway, I'll be putting some of my work up as tutorials eventually, I fucking swear I will. Not that anyone will use it until I'm dead or something. If even.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="article_title1">March 27th, 2020</h1>
        <br>
        <p>So I think it's important to set goals. Otherwise, you're kind of aimlessly working towards nothing. This could lead to derailing, of sorts. I've always had an issue doing that. Anyhow, my job is really kind of pidgeon-holing me into learning things. I've been putting off things for a while to recharge and supplement correcting my burnout.</p>
        <p>Many I.T. professionals are aware, where other trains maybe not: burnout is extremely common in the Information Technology side of the house. There is an overwhelming amount of new information to learn, every single day. Once you've mastered something, it turns out you're working on a deprecated piece of crap technology that 20-year olds and self-proclaimed know-it-alls laugh at. Is it fair? No, but that's just how it works.</p>
        <p>OK,so anyway, I'm working on Cisco training courses for their certifications which have been newly revamped. <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html">You can take a look at them here.</a> I'm certain nobody is going to want to, but I'll probably add some of my first lab entries based on the CCNP professional security level. Cheers!</p>

        <p>Arrgh! I've made another entry, that's two days in a row! Not that I don't work most days, I just don't make entries as often as I should.</p>
        <p>Who knows? Maybe, just maybe, I'll hang out tomorrorw too and do another entry.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="article_title1">March 25th, 2020</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Thus far, I've had a great time creating static websites that aren't quite 'production' material yet. So I've finally had enough and decided it's time that I make things a little more thorough and complete with some server-side capabilities.</p>
        <p>That being said, I've taken it upon myself to begin broaching some php and completing the code to really begin thriving and creating a true platform that will showcase my experience.</p>
        <p>A timeline of updates are due next. Thanks myself, for all of your patience and hard work.</p>
