<p>Arrgh! I've made another entry, that's two days in a row! Not that I don't work most days, I just don't make entries as often as I should.</p>
<p>Who knows? Maybe, just maybe, I'll hang out tomorrorw too and do another entry.</p>

<p>Thus far, I've had a great time creating static websites that aren't quite 'production' material yet. So I've finally had enough and decided it's time that I make things a little more thorough and complete with some server-side capabilities.</p> 
<p>That being said, I've taken it upon myself to begin broaching some php and completing the code to really begin thriving and creating a true platform that will showcase my experience.</p>
<p>A timeline of updates are due next. Thanks myself, for all of your patience and hard work.</p>
